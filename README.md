auto-install
============

This is just a Windows Application that runs CMD commands in the Background. I developed this because, while working in nodeJS, I had to, repeatedly run the same node commands, so this makes my work shorter as I only have to run this application and Voila! It works in the Background while I can work with my more important thing i.e. nodeJS.
