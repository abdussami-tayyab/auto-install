auto-install
============

This is just a Windows Application that runs CMD commands in the Background. I developed this because, while working in nodeJS, I had to, repeatedly run the same node commands, so this makes my work shorter as I only have to run this application and Voila! It works in the Background while I can work with my more important thing i.e. nodeJS.

Documentation
=============

The main program has been commented throughout. However, any queries and improvements would be most welcome.
Other than that, the syntax of "input.txt" is this:

The first line contains the path of the Working Directory.
The rest of the lines contain the commands to be run on the CMD.

Note
====

It can be extended to running other applications and passing them commands. That would be great!
